# Filtros-cruzados---Vanilla
Buscador con filtros cruzados en VanillaJS

Small practice of crossed filters using VanillaJS, so that the development does not take too much time,
use a Skeleton boilerpplate, use normalize.css to harmonize the view according to the browser.
Simulate a very simple DB to be able to take data from there because the idea is to deepen the logic and application of filters
using only JS. To practice eventListeners, high order functions and an object to collect data from the search.
